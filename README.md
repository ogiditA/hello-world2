# hello-world2

a.	The attached application is based on java GUI where the user is prompt to enter information and the program do the calculation. The program is based on javax swing utility called the JOptionPane, which takes input from the user, do the calculation and show the output on the screen. However, it can be programmed to print output by changing the display message dialog.

b.	Trying to construct a very simple application using any of the libraries as was presented was not easy because most of them have documentation issues and missing utility imports. So, the approach I took in creating this program is that of white box reuse strategy. The chosen library is from https://github.com/basoltanifarWVUMix/program1 , where I took few lines of code and modified them to suit my application. White box reuse strategy was very necessary because most of the libraries cannot be used unmodified.
